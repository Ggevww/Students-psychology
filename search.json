    "text": "This data analysis project focuses on the depression levels among students, a critical issue that affects many in educational settings. As a future student myself, I recognize how important it is to address mental health, particularly depression, which can significantly impact academic performance, well-being, and overall quality of life. By analyzing various data points related to student experiences, I aim to uncover patterns and provide insights that could help raise awareness and contribute to finding solutions to this growing problem. Understanding the factors contributing to student depression is a step towards creating a more supportive and healthier learning environment for everyone."

    "text": "This project analyzes the mental health and depression-related data of students, with a specific focus on understanding the prevalence and potential contributing factors of depression within this group. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning projects.\nThe data consists of responses from students regarding their mental health, academic experiences, social interactions, and personal well-being. It serves as a valuable resource for exploring the intersections of academic pressures, social influences, and mental health, which are crucial for understanding and addressing student depression.\nPlease note that while this dataset provides insightful information, it is important to approach the findings with the understanding that the data represents self-reported information and may not fully capture all dimensions of mental health within the student population.\nFor more details, you can access the dataset here"

    "text": "In today’s fast-paced academic environment, mental health issues such as depression have become increasingly prevalent among students. This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of students to uncover patterns and factors associated with depression levels. The dataset contains information on demographics, academic pressure, work pressure, sleep habits, dietary practices, financial stress, satisfaction with study and work, and family history of mental illness.\nThe primary goal of this analysis is to understand how various personal, academic, and lifestyle factors contribute to depression among students. By exploring relationships between variables such as sleep duration, CGPA, financial stress, and suicidal thoughts, we aim to identify key areas that may require attention for mental health support and intervention programs.\nThrough a combination of descriptive statistics, visual exploration, and correlation analysis, this study provides insights that can help educators, counselors, and policymakers develop better strategies to support student mental health and well-being."

The following aspects were analyzed:\n\nGender Distribution: The proportion of male and female students was examined.\nAge Distribution: The age range and average age of the students were explored.\nCity Distribution: The number of students from each major city was calculated.\nProfession: The dominant professions (e.g., Student, Working Professional) were identified.\n\nThese basic insights help characterize the sample and reveal any biases or patterns in the demographic background of the participants."

    "text": "Academic and Work-Related Factors\nThis plot shows a positive relationship between academic pressure and depression levels. As academic pressure increases, there is a slight upward trend in depression symptoms among students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows the distribution of depression cases across different CGPA groups. Students with higher CGPA scores (8–10) report the highest number of depression cases, suggesting a potential link between academic achievement and mental health challenges. Lower CGPA groups (&lt;6) exhibit fewer cases of depression, indicating that higher academic performance may correlate with increased psychological pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows the number of depressed students across different degree types. Students in Class 12 report the highest number of depression cases, followed by degrees like B.Ed, B.Arch, and B.Com. Higher education degrees such as PhD, MBA, and LLM show fewer depression cases, possibly due to smaller sample sizes or better coping mechanisms developed over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatter plot illustrates the relationship between sleep duration and depression levels among students. Sleep duration is categorized into “Less than 5 hours,” “5–6 hours,” “7–8 hours,” “More than 8 hours,” and “Others.” Each point represents an individual student’s depression score, with jittering applied to better display the density of data points. The majority of depression scores fall between 0 and 1.5 across all sleep categories. Students sleeping less than 7 hours tend to show a broader spread of depression levels compared to those sleeping 7–8 hours or more. The “Others” category contains very few observations, suggesting it represents a small and potentially atypical group. Different colors distinguish the sleep categories, and a minimalistic design enhances clarity and focus on the patterns within the data."
