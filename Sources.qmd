This project analyzes the mental health and depression-related data of students, with a specific focus on understanding the prevalence and potential contributing factors of depression within this group. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning projects.

The data consists of responses from students regarding their mental health, academic experiences, social interactions, and personal well-being. It serves as a valuable resource for exploring the intersections of academic pressures, social influences, and mental health, which are crucial for understanding and addressing student depression.

Please note that while this dataset provides insightful information, it is important to approach the findings with the understanding that the data represents self-reported information and may not fully capture all dimensions of mental health within the student population.
